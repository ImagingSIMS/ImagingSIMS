To create a ClickOnce deployment:
1. Open the ImagingSIMS project settings
2. Change the publihing folder location to \ImagingSIMS3\deploy\pub\ of the local path of the repo
3. Make sure the project is set to Release mode. Do not publish Debug versions of the software.
4. In the Changes window, verify that the new folder corresponding to the 
    deployment (i.e. \deploy\pub\Application Files\ImagingSIMS_3_7_1_xxx\ )
    has been added to the Included changes. If it hasn't, expand the Untracked 
    Files section, right click the folder, and add it to the Included changes
5. Commit the changes with the comment "ClickOnce deployment for version *.*.*.*"
	**NOTE: As of 3.6.2.7, Visual Studio will not include redist subfolders (x86 and x64) when 
			detecting changes and committing. Git for Windows will though, so use that to create
			the commit and push to GitHub**
6. Sync changes
